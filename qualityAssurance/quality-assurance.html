      <h2>Security Measures</h2>
      <p>For my website, I have applied Ad Hoc Testing to ensure my website is good to go. First of all, I have used <a href="https://validator.nu/">W3C HTML Validator</a> and
      <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input+with_options">W3C CSS Validator</a> to ensure my website meets the language specifications. Second, I have used
      <a href="https://jshint.com/">jshint</a> to ensure there are no errors in my Javascript files. Then I use console.log a lot to make sure my codes are working.At last, I have used
      both lighthouse auditing and aXe auditing to ensure my codes have met the standard of best coding practices.</p>

      <h2>Code liniting</h2>
      <div>There are many other liniter tools that you can use to identify and fix our codes' style. Top five most popular Javascript Linter are listed below(including Jshint that I
        have mentioned above!)

      <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
      <p>The unit-testing has played an important role in the world of web development. It can ensure all code meets quality standards before the project is deployed.
        It can save time and money in the long term. Plus it will help web developers to write better and efficent codes. Unit testing requires the unit-testing frameworks and assertion libraries.
        Mocha,Jest, and Jasmine are the most popular frameworks of all time. Mocha is lightweight, flexible, and has been one of the top-two frameworks for the last half decade.
        Mocha can works with any assertion library, such as Assert, Expect.js, Should.js, Unexpected.js, or Chai. Chai has been considered as the most popular library so far.
        It uses BBD syntax. If you want see an example of mocha testing, please download this <a href="https://github.com/tix980/Http5201-Final_assignment-TingweiXie">repo</a>, then
        go to the /test/test.js and run the commands "npm install" & "npm run test".
